# About Me
I am a PhD candidate at Penn State University, University Park. I am honored to be advised by Tom La Porta and Trent Jaeger. I am also grateful for the collaboration and guidance from Terly Taylor and Fred Araujo. My research focuses on cybersecurity, with a particular interest in security for Software-Defined Networking (SDN). I am expected to graduate in Spring 2025.
